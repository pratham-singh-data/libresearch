# LibreSearch

## Overview
This is a free and open source search engine that fetches results from the Google Search API from apigeek from RapidAPI

## Features

1. Full webapp is responsive and built using MaterialUI and React.

2. The home page shows the logo of the application and allows you to enter a search query.

3. After pressing enter on typing a non-empty string, you will be redirected to the search page where you can select from normal searches, images, videos and news tabs.

4. The search page has an application logo, which upon clicking redirects the user to the homepage, same action occurs on entering an empty string.

5. The application features a circular scroller while content is loading and each tab shows by default 15 entries (except the images tab which defaults to 10) and this limit can be exceeded by clicking the "Load More" button which appears as long as there is more data to display.
